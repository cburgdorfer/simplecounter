# simplecounter
The idea is to create a simple counter that counts upwards every time the php script is called. No database needed. It's stored as json in the filesystem

# Prerequisites
- php to run run.sh script

# Installation
- clone
- create file var.json
- give var the respective ownership and rights so it can be read and written by php
- give run.sh the rights to be executed
- run ./run.sh
